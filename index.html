    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
    <p class="left-align">With a first-class degree in Business and Management, I have cultivated a strong foundation in both creative and analytical skills, further refined through a digital marketing bootcamp and hands-on entrepreneurial work. My role in managing social media campaigns has produced measurable outcomes, such as a 57% increase in engagement and a 15% rise in conversions for two start-up businesses that I founded. I am familiar with analytical tools such as Google Analytics 4 and Instagram Ads Manager, as well as content creation tools including Canva and CapCut. I enjoy crafting strategies that blend creativity and data to deliver effective marketing solutions. Dedicated to continuous improvement and producing high-quality work, I am confident that I can leverage my foundational understanding of consumer behaviour and adapt to new technologies and media trends, ensuring I stay ahead of the curve. I am excited to apply my skills and contribute to a dynamic team where I can make a meaningful impact in the digital marketing field.</p>
